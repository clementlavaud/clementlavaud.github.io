# ðŸ”¬ Research & Results

Currently working on finding a way to describe accurately and classify mathematically the physical problem at hands by trying to figure out how to handle the operator involved the inverse problem we study.

## ðŸ§© Current Work
**Image Reconstruction and analysis in fluorescence diffuse optical tomography**  
Finding a robust way to compute efficiently an image in fluorescence diffuse optical tomography by using Hybrid methods.  
*Methods:* Unrolled Networkds, Weighted Least Squares, Operator.  

## ðŸ§  Previous Work
**Biomedical Image Classification for pre-diagnosis** â€” Convolutional Neural Networks modelling and efficient learning for photo-refraction image interpretation in the extreme cases.  
**AI-generated Text Detection** â€” Classification using transformer embeddings.
**Statistical Analysis of the recruitment of young players in the NBA** - My master's thesis, which was all done in R.
